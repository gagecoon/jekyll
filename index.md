I'm an environmental scientist at The University of Tennessee looking for PhD positions. My current work is in the [Steen Lab](https://adsteen.github.io/) as a lab technician/post-baccalaureate scholar. In the past, I have been part of the [Lloyd Lab](https://lloydlab.utk.edu/) and [the Silva Nova project](https://www.above-belowgroundinteractions.com/silva-nova).
